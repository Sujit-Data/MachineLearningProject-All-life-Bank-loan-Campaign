# MachineLearningProject-All-life-Bank-loan-Campaign
AllLife Bank is a US bank that has a growing customer base. The majority of these customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying sizes of deposits. Me as a Data scientist at bank have to build a model that will help the marketing department to identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan.
